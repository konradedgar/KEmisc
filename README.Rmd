# KEmisc

KEmisc provides a disorganised collection of small convenience and utility functions. I mostly use this package as remote storage for functions that I want to have available. It's rather unlikely that anyone will find it useful.

## Installation

```{r pkg_install, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
if (!require("devtools")) {
    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github('konradedgar/Kmisc')
} else {
    devtools::install_github('konradedgar/Kmisc')
}
```
