Kmisc
=====

Kmisc provides a disorganised collection of small convenience and
utility functions. I mostly use this package as remote storage for
functions that I want to have available across different environments.
Itâ€™s rather unlikely that anyone will find it useful.

Installation
------------

``` r
if (!require("devtools")) {
    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github('konradedgar/Kmisc')
} else {
    devtools::install_github('konradedgar/Kmisc')
}
```
