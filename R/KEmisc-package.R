#' @title KEmisc: collection of miscellaneous functions
#'
#' @name KEmisc-package
#'
#' @description KEmisc provides a disorganised collection of convenience and
#'   utility functions.
#'
#' @details The package was developed out of need to keep random handy functions,
#'  which don't appear to belong anywhere in one place.
#'
#' @section Acknowledgements:
#' The following package is developed in the open with frequent use of
#'   StackOverflow. I've strived to reference relevant discussions in the
#'   code and acknowledgements sections. Ultimately, all relevant discussion
#'   can be found back via my
#'   \href{https://stackoverflow.com/users/1655567/konrad?tab=questions}{SO profile.}
